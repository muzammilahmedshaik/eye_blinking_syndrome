# eye_blinking_syndrome
Detects unusual blinks of the patients to classify the patients for syndromes
An eye twitch is an involuntary, abnormal blinking of your eyelid. If your eye twitching is frequent, it may affect your vision. Occasional eye twitches are common.
If you have eye twitches more often, you may have a condition called benign essential blepharospasm.
This syndrome can be detected by counting blinks of the eye.
